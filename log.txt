-difficulty:
	easy - 3 lives, defualt
	normal - defualt
	hard - 3 powers per level
	true - no powers
- Horizontal black bars blocking visibility of vertical black bars 
- Add a scoreboard or header at the top or to the left t move score, level, deaths, etc. to a less involved area. 
- Increase difficulty on later levels, specifically 14 and 15. I thought 9 and 13 were both harder. (But maybe that was just me improving) 
- Add other elements to difficulty. Forced hyperspeed, limit ability uses, etc. Possibly restricted for "hard mode"  
- Resize screen on mouse move
